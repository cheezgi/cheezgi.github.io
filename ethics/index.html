    <h1>The Ethics Bug</h1>
    <p>
      <img src="brain.jpg" style="width:30%;">
      The Ethics Bug is a vulnerability affecting every programmer in the software industry. This weakness allows malicious actors to create
      software that violates against public interest, which under normal conditions, would be prevented by the better judgement of the developer, allowing any
      company, executive, or project manager in a position of power over their developers to bypass normal moral and legal boundaries.
    </p>
    <h2 style="clear:both;">Background</h2>
    <p>
      Software today is a fundamental part of our modern information-based economy. Although relatively new to human society, most interactions
      between people and their social and physical environments are enabled by software. Software today is a means for communication, production,
      transportation, navigation, advertisement, bookkeeping, and statistical analysis and prediction. With software having eaten the world, it is
      essential that the software industry recognizes the possible ethical implications that come with being such a keystone of our society. Most
      importantly, the software industry should recognize how the employer-employee relationship affects ethicality as well as ethical
      codes that have been laid out by standards bodies and how they relate to making ethical business decisions. Although the "Ethics Bug" isn't an
      actual software or hardware vulnerability like as in Heartbleed or Meltdown/Spectre, its implications on the software industry are just
      as if not more important.
    </p>
    <h2>Hazards</h2>
    <p>
      This vulnerability has already been exploited several times. The most severe recent example has been the Dieselgate emissions scandal
      caused by Volkswagen in which the company successfully attempted to go around emissions standards for their diesel engines (Chappell).
      Volkswagen contracted German company Bosch to create engine controller software to detect when it was being tested for emissions compliance and
      reduce the engine's fuel intake by a considerable margin to decrease emissions to an acceptable level. Under normal circumstances,
      any employee in the chain of command responsible could have stopped the violation of emissions standards, the Ethics Bug prevented
      them from taking action.
    </p><p>
      Another more subtle example of an exploit is one user's story of a web project they worked on. This project
      was a questionnaire designed to market a prescription drug toward potential users, which unethically would persuade users to take the drug
      even if their symptoms didn't align with those the drug attempted to treat (Bort). The relatively inexperienced software engineer had
      little knowledge of drug advertisement laws in their country, which opened up the Ethics Bug as an avenue for exploitation. The drug
      would later be linked to increased depression and one suicide.
    </p>

        <h2>What this means</h2>
        <p>
          Society at large is at risk to the ethical negligence of the software industry. Practically every facet of today's global society is
          in some way influenced by the decisions of a few key companies like Google, Facebook, or Amazon. Although the software industry provides much
          more mobility for software engineers and programmers, typing a few questionable keystrokes over the course of a day or two has a much lower
          perceived risk than losing their employment.
        </p><p>
          There are still unanswered questions surrounding the extent of the Ethics Bug's influence.
          Regarding the employee-employer relationship, a much larger strain to conform to company policies of secrecy is placed on the employee.
          Non-disclosure agreements preventing employees from disclosing information to others make activism outside of litigation difficult (Sebastian).
          These restrictions on communication, even within companies, hurts the ability of employees to bring light to ethical transgressions, and
          might even prove harmful for business, according to Clifford J. Ehrlich, Senior Vice President of Human Resources for Marriott International.

        <h2>Workarounds</h2>
        <p>
          Some potential solutions include more legal protections for workers in the software industry. Whistleblowing protections exist in much of the Western
          world, although current political climates do not favor the employee in raising ethical awareness. Current laws do not account for a much more
          global society and economy intertwined with software than even ten years ago. New legislation is a much more long-term fix for this vulnerability.
          Patches and hotfixes are starting to make an appearance, however.
        </p><p>
          A code of ethics has been published by the IEEE which promotes adherence to "public interest" for software engineers and managers (Gotterbarn).
          These ethical standards require that software engineers "accept full responsibility for their own work," however in some cases responsibility for ethical violations is unclear.
          An increase in awareness of this code could help to lessen the spread of exploits of the Ethics Bug.

    <h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
    <p>
      <h4>Who is vulnerable to the Ethics Bug?</h4>
      The software industry as a whole is vulnerable to exploitation. The most at-risk include programmers and software developers
      new to the industry. Attacks most commonly come from executives, upper-level managers, or project managers looking to forgo
      the public interest in pursuit of monetary gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>Who is affected by this bug?</h4>
      Everyone who interacts software, directly or indirectly. This includes but is not limited to
      <ul>
        <li>Anyone who interacts with Internet-of-Things or "smart" devices</li>
        <li>Anyone who interacts with "artificial intelligence" like Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa</li>
        <li>Anyone who receives radiation therapy (Levenson)</li>
        <li>Anyone who uses a computer, laptop, tablet, or phone</li>
        <li>Anyone who uses a modern internal combustion engine</li>
        <li>Anyone who travels via means not powered by human or animal</li>
        <li>Anyone who uses a credit or debit card, or stores money in a bank</li>
        <li>Anyone who interacts with an electronic device</li>
        <li>Anyone who interacts with the power grid</li>
        <li>Anyone who relies on municipal water</li>
        <li>Anyone who relies on a functioning government</li>
        <li>Anyone who consumes foods not grown or raised themselves</li>
      </ul>
      More possible avenues for exploitation are being discovered daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>What are some possible outcomes?</h4>
      The fastest-approaching issues are in the form of privacy problems. The interconnected nature of society with the rise of social media
      platforms could mean an end to complete privacy. Today, it is much more difficult to completely disconnect yourself from someone
      without cutting yourself off from everyone else.
    </p><p>
      A much more pressing issue is climate change. A lack of attention to the scientific consensus for several decades has led to the increase
      in global temperatures already by around 1.6 degrees Celsius from the mid 1800s. Programmers, and in particular software companies need
      to pay more attention to the environmental impact of their products to help postpone the complete collapse of human civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>How can I protect myself?</h4>
      Because every aspect of a modern person's life is influenced by software, there is no way to completely avoid being affected by the Ethics Bug.
      Currently, the best way to avoid the possible outcomes of the Ethics Bug is to raise awareness of the Ethics Bug not only within the software industry
      but outside it as well. Even non-software engineers could stand to benefit from ethical protections.
